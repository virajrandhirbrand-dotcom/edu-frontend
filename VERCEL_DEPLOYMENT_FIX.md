# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Problem
The deployment was failing with a permission error: `sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/node_modules/.bin/vite: Permission denied`

## The Solution
I've simplified the configuration to let Vercel handle everything automatically:

### Changes Made:

1. **Simplified `vercel.json`** - Only handles SPA routing, no build configuration
2. **Simplified `vite.config.js`** - Removed complex build optimizations that might cause issues
3. **Added `.vercelignore`** - Optimized deployment

## Next Steps:

### Option 1: Push Changes and Redeploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - simplify configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Delete and Recreate Project (Recommended)
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Delete the current project
3. Create a new project
4. Import the same repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Vite and configure everything

### Option 3: Manual Configuration in Vercel Dashboard
If you want to keep the current project:
1. Go to Project Settings → Build & Development Settings
2. Set:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Environment Variables
Add in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
- **VITE_API_URL**: `https://edu-backend-qss8.vercel.app`

## Why This Fixes It
- Removed conflicting build configurations
- Let Vercel's automatic detection handle the build process
- Simplified configuration reduces potential permission issues
- Vercel's Vite integration is more reliable than custom configs

## Expected Result
✅ Build should complete successfully  
✅ App will be deployed with SPA routing  
✅ API calls will work with your backend  
✅ Environment variables properly configured  

The deployment should now work without permission errors!
